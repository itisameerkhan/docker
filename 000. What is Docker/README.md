# What is Docker 

In traditional development, if Developer A builds a project using PHP, MySQL, and Apache, everything works perfectly on his system because he has already installed and configured those tools with specific versions. But when Developer B or 1000 other developers try to run the same project, they may not have PHP, MySQL, or Apache installed. Even if they install them, the versions may be different, leading to compatibility issues. Some developers may face configuration errors, missing dependencies, or operating system limitations. This process wastes a lot of time and creates frustration. Docker solves this problem by packaging the application along with its required software, dependencies, and configurations into a container. That container runs the same way on every computer, regardless of the operating system or installed software. Developers no longer need to manually install or configure everything — they simply run the Docker container, and the environment is ready instantly.
